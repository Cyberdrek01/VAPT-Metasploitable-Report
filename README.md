Target IP: 192.168.1.4

Assessment Type: Internal Penetration Test

Testing Environment: Kali Linux (Attacker) & Metasploitable (Target)

Authorization: Educational / Lab-based testing only

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Nmap

Network discovery

Port scanning

Service and version enumeration

Metasploit Framework

Exploitation of known vulnerabilities

Payload delivery

Session handling

Netcat

Manual shell interaction

Bind and reverse shell verification

🚨 Vulnerability Summary

The assessment identified multiple Critical severity vulnerabilities leading to complete system compromise (root access).

ID	Vulnerability	Service	Severity
FIND-01	vsftpd v2.3.4 Backdoor RCE	FTP (21)	Critical
FIND-02	Samba Usermap Script RCE	SMB (139/445)	Critical
FIND-03	Unprotected Bind Shell	TCP (1524)	Critical
🧨 Exploitation Results

Successfully gained root shell access via vsftpd backdoor

Executed remote code execution as root using Samba misconfiguration

Verified unauthenticated bind shell allowing direct system access

These findings confirm that the target system is critically insecure and vulnerable to immediate compromise.
